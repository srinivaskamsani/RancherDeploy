# Rancher Deploy


A command line application to deploy docker application to Rancher. 
RancherDeploy aims to keep its interface as similar as possible to
the docker CLI's in order to provide an intuitive user experience.
The main purpose of this script is to make it easier 
to enable continuous delivery and pairs nicely with Jenkins and Bamboo.
Currently, this app can create and remove stacks, services, and load
balancers. If a stack or service doesn't exist it will create one.
The app also has the ability to upgrade existing services.

RancherDeploy also ships with a python wrapper for the Rancher API
that you can use to create your own tools and utilities.

## Installation

### PIP

RanchdeDeploy is available in pypi and can be installed 
using pip : 

``` pip install rancherdelpoy  ```

### Docker

To build the Docker image :

``` docker build -t rancherdeploy .  ```

Once the image is build, bash into the container with:

``` docker run -it rancherdeploy bash ```

Once inside the container, RancherDeploy should be available as a CLI.

## Usage for RancherDeploy library

As mentioned above, RancherDeploy ships with a wrapper for the rancher 
API that can be used to create custom scripts. This is the same 
library used to create the CLI and can do a all of the same functions 
including listing stacks and services, deleting stacks and services,
creating/upgrading stacks, services and load balancers. The example 
below demonstrates some of these functionalities.

```
>>> from RancherDeploy.Rancher import Rancher
>>> rancher = Rancher(url, (user,passw), v)
>>> rancher.stacks # List stacks
[healthcheck, network-services, ipsec, scheduler, Test1, Test2]
>>> rancher.stacks[-1].services # List services
[Hello1, Hello2]
>>> rancher.stacks[-1].services[0].status # Check status of services
'active'
>>> rancher.stacks[-1].services[0].remove() # Delete services
>>> rancher.stacks[-1].services
[Hello2]
>>> rancher.stacks[-1].remove() # Delete stacks
>>> rancher.stacks
[healthcheck, network-services, ipsec, scheduler, Test1]
>>>
```

## Troubleshooting


This script was developed against the v2-beta api and Rancher
V1.6.2. No other versions were tested.  If any error occur, verify the
version of Rancher and the API.
